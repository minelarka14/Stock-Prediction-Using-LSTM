            <p>This is a machine learning algorithm made with tensorflow and python. This was made for
                our open theme badge for scouts. It uses long short term memory as the name implies and uses tkinter and
                matplotlib for the GUI and visualisation. </p>
            <br>
            <p> We created this project using The open theme badge requirements:</p> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Decide to pursue any area of interest or skill he/ she is interested in that broadly covers a
                    certain theme or category such as sports, aeronautics, science, performing arts, etc. <br></li>
                <li><br>Identify an area that is not covered by the existing syllabus of the Scout Proficiency Badges
                    and
                    submit a write-up or proposal of the project he/ she would like to do to the National Scout
                    Roundtable, with support from the Scout Leader</li>
